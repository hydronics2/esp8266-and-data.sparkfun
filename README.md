# esp8266-and-data.sparkfun

Sends a GET from a nodeMcu esp8266.  Programmed in Arduino.

To use this sketch, Go to data.sparkfun.com and get a public and provate key and set up the variable name so that it matches the variable your sending, 'vName'. Mine is called 'gs' as this will be from an accelerometer.  Also set your wifi ssid and password.
